## What this tool does:
**This tool finds rows from Group B that are NOT present in Group A**

### How it works:
1. Upload your **reference CSV files** to Group A (the "master list" to compare against)
2. Upload your **target CSV files** to Group B (the files you want to check)
3. Select which columns to compare between the groups
4. The tool will show you **all rows from Group B where the selected column value doesn't exist in Group A**

### Example:
- CSV A has people I have already contacted: John, Mary, Bob
- CSV B has all of the People in my lead list. for: John, Mary, Sarah, Mike
- **Result**: Shows you rows for Sarah and Mike (People in your lead list who have not been contacted)
